# Remix Project Coding Standards
- NEVER use remix-run for imports.
    AI frequently wants to use older import patterns. This prevents that.
- This is a react-router project in framework mode
- Prefer loader/action pattern over traditional fetches and api calls.
- In loaders/actions use raw json returns unless we need to specify a status, then use the data function from react-router
   ```
   return data(jsonData, {status: 200})
   ```
- If the loader or action is a pure api route, then we instead need to return with Response.json(jsonData, options)
- Prefer our wrapper function for loaders/actions to gauruntee proper auth protections
   ```
    export const loader = createAuthLoader(
	async ({ request, params, userContext }) => {
            const user = sessionData?.user;

            //logic
        
    }, true); //false if we don't want auth on this route
   ```
- When using an api call, use the useFetch hook and utilize the loading prop for better UX.
